# Hi-Five - Password Manager

## Documentation

## Problem:-

Nowadays all applications are protected by different passwords to secure our accounts on different platforms.In organisational levels, we require passwords to be shared securely.But there is an issue that most of us tend to forget all our passwords.As a solution to this we have implemented a software to store all our passwords.We can also keep our Important documents ,notes,credit card information,bookmarks and so on.
